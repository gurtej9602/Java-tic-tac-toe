# Java tic-tac-toe
This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The game allows two players to play against each other on the same device. The GUI is designed to be simple, intuitive, and user-friendly, providing an engaging gameplay experience.
# Features
* **Two-Player Mode:** Play with a friend on the same device.
* **Interactive GUI:** Built using Java's Swing library for smooth interactions.
* **Win Detection:** Automatically detects when a player wins or when there's a draw.
* **Minimalistic Design:** Clean layout with clear symbols (X and O).
* **VS Random Mode (Beta):** Compete against a random move generator for unpredictable gameplay. Note: This mode is still in beta and may have limited functionality.
# Technologies Used
* **Programming Language:** Java
* **GUI Framework:** Swing (Java Foundation Classes)
# How to Run
1. Prerequisites:
   * Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or above).
   * A Java IDE (like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans) or a simple text editor with command-line support.
2. Steps to Run:
   * Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
   * Open the project in your IDE or navigate to the folder via the command line.
   * Compile the Java file:
     ```bash
     javac Main.java
     ```
   * Run the compiled class:
     ```bash
     java Main
     ```
# Game Rules
* The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
* Player 1 uses X and Player 2 uses O.
* Players take turns placing their marks in an empty cell.
* The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
* If all nine cells are filled without any winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
* In VS Random Mode, the opponent makes random moves without any strategic logic.
